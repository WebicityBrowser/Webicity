Webicity is a simple web browser that I am working on (it is unfinished).

Webicity consists of multiple components:
* Webicity browser: A graphical UI for Webicity, so that users can actually use Webicity.
* Webicity: Responsible for rendering content.
* Thready: Provides a GUI component system, and interfaces with the preferred drawing system.
* Thready web extensions: Part of Webicity. Allows for rendering web pages with Thready.
