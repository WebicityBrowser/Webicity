/**
 * This package includes a drawing API that can be used
 * to draw primitive shapes and text to a canvas. The
 * API is designed such that it can be implemented by
 * different backends (such as Skija, Java2D, etc.).
 * This API only draws basic shapes and text - it does
 * not include a component system or other higher-level
 * drawing abstractions.
